Connect developers to code together based on shared interists.

People connect via GitHub connect and create profiles. From their profiles they can make project pages. Other users can search for projects based on code language and topics (i.e. sharing economy) and can either star or apply to projects.

Project owners can deny applicants or let them in as collaborators, but before they do they can review profiles and schedule times to interview or better yet schedule a time to pair program together.

Any developers who work with Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z or Kanye West, please contact me directly.
